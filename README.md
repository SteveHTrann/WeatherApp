# WeatherApp
This is one of the first full-stack web app that I made using API's in my javascript. This weather app will search for any destination in the world and return back the weather in both Farenheit and Celcius.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For the content, I would use HTML to get an idea of what users will see when interacting with the app. Once I got the content, I will then use CSS to style it so it would look good both on mobile and desktop.

For the Javascript, this is one of the first time's I've worked with APIs.

Essentially, what I ended up doing was using postman.com to test out an API that I found from https://openweathermap.org/api. I use postman because it simplifies the process for me to view API objects and make a judgement call on weather I can work with it or not.

Once I decided that the API is something I will use, I'll add it into my javascript file so I can begin keying into a specific property to get the value.


Lessons Learned:


To make a fully-responsive app, there is MANY SMALL PROCESSES that build upon one another.  Building an app requires non-stop planning, testing, coding, and implementing to ensure the final product will be stable for use. Additionally, the final product will HOPEFULLY not break while undergoing updates for improvements. 

I also realized that coding is such a small part of the process. The planning, reading documentations, understanding problems and researching takes up most of the time when building the app.
