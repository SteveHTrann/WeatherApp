# WeatherApp
This is my weather app.

Thank you for checking out my Weather app repository.

This is one of my first full-stack web apps that I've built to help develop my skills working with API's.


How it's made:

API object came from: https://openweathermap.org/api

Lessons learned:

The Biggest lesson I learned while building this project is to break problems down into small, achieveable, steps. API's will always return objects that can have many nestings, so its importaant to play with the API,
break it, fix it, and then use the correct key upon learning the key value properites

I still have a long ways to go, however, a journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.
